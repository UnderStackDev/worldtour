🌍 World Tour Challenge 2025

"Forget wool socks. This year, I gave my friends the world."

World Tour is a gamified cultural journey designed to break you out of your algorithmic bubble. The mission is simple but epic: consume one piece of culture (Movie or Music) from every single independent country in the world (193 nations).

🏭 The UnderStack Story
This project was built in Jämsä, Finland, in the shadow of a paper mill smokestack.

I am not a coder. I work in heavy industry. This entire project was created with a 0€ budget using a "No-Code" philosophy. Every single line of code was written by Gemini AI, acting as my junior developer, while I served as the architect and prompt engineer.

From paper to pixels. 🌲 -> 💻

🌟 The Philosophy: Experience > Competition

Most apps want you to compete, grind, and stress about streaks. World Tour is different.

No Leaderboards: This is your personal travel diary.

Gastro Loot: Watching a movie from Spain? Eat some tapas. Drinking a warm beer counts too. It's about the vibe, not the performance.

Tier List Ratings: No more agonizing over "3 vs 4 stars". Is it a 🔥 BANGER, 🍿 POPCORN, or 💀 TRASH?

Smart AI Curator: Don't know what to watch from Bhutan? The built-in smart prompt helps you ask your own AI for tailored recommendations based on your progress.

📦 Features

Offline-First: Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Works like a native app on Android/iOS.

Interactive Map: Watch the world turn from outline to colored as you conquer nations.

Two Editions:

Movie Edition: For the deep dive (2h commitment).

Music Edition: For the daily explorer (3min commitment). Includes "Rare Loot" for listening to full albums.

Privacy Focused: Currently runs 100% in your browser's Local Storage. Your data is yours.
