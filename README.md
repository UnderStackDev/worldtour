🌍 World Tour Challenge 2025

"Forget wool socks. This year, I gave my friends the world."

World Tour is a gamified cultural journey designed to break you out of your algorithmic bubble. The mission is simple but epic: consume one piece of culture (Movie or Music) from every single independent country in the world (193 nations).

🖥️ The Experience

Best experienced on a Desktop or Tablet. While the app works on mobile, the interactive map is the heart of the experience. You want to see the world turn from outline to neon-colored as you conquer nations. It's your personal "War Room" for culture.


🎮 How to Play

Download the HTML file (or clone this repo). 

Open index.html (Movies) or music.html (Music) in any modern web browser.

Conquer the world.


🏭 The UnderStack Story

This project was built in Jämsä, Finland, in the shadow of a paper mill smokestack.

I am not a coder. I work in heavy industry. This entire project was created with a 0€ budget using a "No-Code" philosophy. Every single line of code was written by Gemini AI, acting as my junior developer, while I served as the architect and prompt engineer.

From pulp to pixels. 🌲 -> 💻



🌟 The Philosophy: Experience > Competition
Most apps want you to compete, grind, and stress about streaks. World Tour is different.

No Leaderboards: This is your personal travel diary.

Gastro Loot: Watching a movie from Spain? Eat some tapas. Drinking a warm beer counts too. It's about the vibe, not the performance.

Smart AI Curator: Don't know what to watch from Bhutan? The built-in smart prompt helps you ask your own AI for tailored recommendations based on your progress and ratings.
